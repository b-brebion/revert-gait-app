# SwiftDevelopment

## JointsDetection
#### To be done
- Async body detection (in order to remove the small lag at the beginning)
- More information in the JSON file (e.g. about the position of the camera?)
- Try to have vectors between the joints displayed on the screen
- Various code optimisations
